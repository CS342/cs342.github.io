                        <p>
                            As our world becomes more and more digitized, patients and their devices are generating streams 
                            of valuable data that can provide meaningful clinical insights. This digital health revolution 
                            provides great opportunities to design and validate new digital health concepts. Many groups 
                            within Stanford Medicine have promising ideas that are ripe for development, however, they lack 
                            the software engineering and healthcare compliance know-how to take them forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Building for Digital Health is a Biodesign course sponsored by the Stanford School of Medicine (SoM) 
                            and Stanford's Computer Science (CS) department. Its goal is to provide CS students with the 
                            opportunity to apply their skills to real-world health technology development projects, while 
                            enabling SoM faculty to leverage these talented individuals to help advance their technology 
                            concepts toward patients. Both audiences will learn a repeatable approach for developing new 
                            digital health technologies and preparing to launch them in the market.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                            Over the course of ten weeks, students and faculty will work together to tackle a project and 
                            launch an app-enabled solution for research use. Every week, students will learn about app-development, 
                            sensor technologies, privacy, security, and more. In the final week of class, teams will present 
                            their final project (app) to a panel of digital health experts.

                                The University of Utah provides care for a wide region (Mountain West) covering many remote areas making access to care and coordination of care challenging. The system is government funded and has a history of collecting patient reported outcomes (PROs) in person to assess quality of life and functional capacity measures. The Division of Vascular Surgery is interested in expanding this program via a mobile application to achieve broader adoption, increase accessibility and to gain improved longitudinal data. This project will include building the application in iOS and will include 1) consenting, 2) collecting HealthKit data metrics (including passive activity), 3) Deploying PRO surveys, 4) Deploying active tasks such as the remote 6-minute-walk test, among other features.

                                ​​Arrhythmia symptoms are frequent complaints in children and often require a pediatric cardiology referral. Wearable technologies, such as the Apple Watch®, have been studied in adults but there are limited data on the utility of these wearable technologies in children. We hypothesized that an Apple Watch can be used to identify clinically significant arrhythmias in children. Since 2018, the Stanford group has had 41 pediatric patients detect arrhythmias on an Apple Watch which were later confirmed through traditional clinical  methods. Dr. Ceresnak’s group would like to develop an iOS research application which leverages the Apple watch to collect ECG tracings in pediatric patients. Their application will have the standard 1) onboarding consent, 2) PRO/survey collection, 3) Apple Watch ECG Active task, among other features.

                                Eating disorders are a common condition many teenagers and young adults suffer from. 
                                Sometimes the condition requires a hospital admission to help manage this condition. Dr. Locke’s group specializes in the treatment of anorexia and bulimia. In particular he studies dialectical behavioral therapy treatments and is looking to build a companion application to support patients in-between therapy sessions- which is most of the time! For this project you will build a new iOS app which will include, 1) Onboarding/Consenting, 2) Survey assessments/PROs, and several others which could include 3) setting up an “SOS” button, 4) a “Distract Me” feature, 5)  a “Let’s Chill Out” feature, 6) a “Feeling Learning” feature, or 7) a Diary feature.

                                GetMoovin is an app/digital system focused on motivating seniors to
                                engage in physical activity to improve their healthspan. The aging process
                                decreases one’s muscle strength, agility, and cardiovascular fitness leading
                                to frailty and chronic disease. GetMoovin’s free app engages families and
                                friends in synchronous photo curation of physical activities. The 
                                subscription side provides customers personalized plans to mitigate the 
                                decline of aging so they will be able to do the things that really matter to 
                                them as they age. We want to give people the Gift of a Better Healthspan.

                                Eczematous dermatoses are a group of common inflammatory skin disorders, also known as dermatitis. Currently, patch testing is only offered in specialty clinics, and the procedure typically requires three visits to the specialty clinic within a week. The limited number of specialty clinics nationwide and the fact that specialty clinics are mostly concentrated in large cities and academic centers make access to care very limited. Only a small portion of patients who benefit from patch testing have access to this test. A cost analysis study of patients with eczema shows that among 2.6 million patients with eczema and continuous enrollment at the IBM market scan dataset between 2014-2016 only about 2% had patch testing. Patient with patch testing had an average 50% reduction in direct cost of care in the year following patch testing compared to the prior year. This project aims to facilitate access to care through a multimodal digital health solution for patients with chronic eczema, facilitate patch testing from a remote location, and interpretation of patch test results through AI augmented analysis of sequential photos from the allergen application site.

                        <br/>
                        No more than one unexcused absence is permitted. A second absence may be permitted 
                        with written justification by the student and fulfillment of a make-up assignment. 
                        Two or more unexcused absences will lead to a No CR grade. 

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <b>Amount of Work Expected</b>
                        <br/>
                        Teams can expect up to 7-9 hours of work each week beyond classroom hours. 
                        A majority of the effort is spent researching needs, meeting need coaches and 
                        mentors, interviewing stakeholders, and coding solutions as a team.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <b>Deliverables</b>
                        <br/>
                        Teams will complete a midterm and final presentation, discussing progress and functionality. 
                        The final deliverable will be a research-ready iOS mobile application hosted on GitHub. 
                        Code and IP created is governed by Stanford's standard IP procedures, and will be used to 
                        inform University research.

                        <b>Trainings and Certifications</b>
                        <br/>
                        Health research requires adherence to strict security and privacy protocols, and Stanford 
                        requires researchers working in this area to obtain specific certifications. Specifically,
                        a Stanford HIPAA certificate is required, and will be obtained through 
                        <a href="https://starsexpress.stanford.edu/index.html?ref=LM_SS_LEARNING.LM_BROWSE_LEARNER.GBL&type=COURSE&code=PRIV-2022">starsexpress.stanford.edu</a>. 
                        This certification will enable students to work on other IRB-approved research, and is a requirement 
                        for most research within the School of Medicine. This training is offered through the STARS 
                        system (use the link above).

                        <b>Coding and Requirements</b>
                        <br/>
                        Teams will be coding throughout the quarter. We require that you have taken CS106A/B or equivalent. 
                        We highly recommend some experience with mobile platforms (CS193P/A, CS47), OR web platforms (CS142).
                        Since we are working primarily on iOS, you will need access to a macOS computer running Xcode.
                        The Macs in residential clusters and at Lathrop come with Xcode pre-installed. You can checkout Macbook
                        Airs from the Tech Desk for up to 4 weeks through this link. See list of computers on-campus with Xcode 
                        here or here.

                            Students with Documented Disabilities: 
                            Students who may need academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate 
                            the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the 
                            request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an 
                            Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. 
                            Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate
                            accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk 
                            (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
