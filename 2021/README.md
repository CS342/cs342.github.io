## Overview

Building for Digital Health is a new Biodesign course sponsored by the Stanford School of Medicine (SoM) and Stanfordâ€™s Computer Science (CS) department. Its goal is to give CS students the opportunity to apply their skills to real-world health technology development projects, while enabling SoM faculty to leverage these talented individuals to help advance their technology concepts toward patients. Both audiences will learn a repeatable approach for developing new digital health technologies and preparing to launch them in the market.
